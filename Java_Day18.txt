Spring - Beans Auto-Wiring
Sol. The Spring container can autowire relationships between collaborating beans without using <constructor-args> and <property> elements, which helps cut down on the amount of XML configuration you write for a big Spring-based application.


Annotation Based Configuration
Sol. There are 4 types of Annotation Based Configuration :
    1. @Required : It applies to a bean property setter methods. 
    2. @Autowired : It can be apply to bean property setter methods, non-setter methods, constructor and properties.
    3. @Qualifier : It can be used along with @Autowired  to remove the confusion by specifying which exact bean will be wired.
    4. @JSR-250 Annotation : It includes @Resource, @PostConstructs and @PreDestroy.
