"Java I/O Fundamentals:
 *Read and write data from the console
 Use *BufferedReader, *BufferedWriter, *File, *FileReader, *FileWriter, *FileInputStream, 
 *FileOutputStream, ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream, and *PrintWriter in 
 the java.io package.

 Java File I/O (NIO.2)
 *Use Path interface to operate on file and directory paths
 Use Files class to check, read, delete, copy, move, manage metadata of a file or 
 directory

""Building Database Applications with JDBC
 *Describe the interfaces that make up the core of the JDBC API including the Driver, 
 Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces and their relationship to provider 
 implementations.
 Sol. Driver : Provide API for registering drivers based on JDBC (every driver class must implement it).Generally used only by the DriverManager class.
    DriverManager : To make a connection with the driver.
    Connection : Provide methods for creating statements and managing connections with a data source and their properties.
    Statement : Object used for executing a static SQL statement and returning the result its produces.
    ResultSet : Object used for retrieving and updating the result of a query.

    To use the JDBC API with a particular DBMS,you need a JDBC driver to establish the communication between the database.JDBC drivers are divided into four types:

    Type 1 : JDBC-ODBC
    Type 2 : Native-API,partly java driver
    Type 3 : Network-protocol,all-Java driver
    Type 4 : Native protocol, all-Java driver

    The DriverManager class tacks the loaded JDBC drivers and creates the database connection. Before JDBC 4.0, the Driver Class was loaded with this code.

    Class.ForName("com.jw.client.JWDDriver");

    Now, DriverManager.getConnection()


 *Identify the components required to connect to a database using the DriverManager 
 class including the JDBC URL
 
 *Submit queries and read results from the database including creating statements, 
 returning result sets, iterating through the results, and properly closing result sets, 
 statements, and connections"""
